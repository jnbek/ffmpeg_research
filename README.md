# ffmpeg_research
My noodlings with ffmpeg. Most of this stuff is using ffmpeg-master from April 2022 which I believe is the 5x tree. Use at your own risk. Some are on Windows 10 Powershell and some are on Linux ZSH 
See https://gist.github.com/jnbek/ad15ad30a5a30399c8b27f18deb7d33e for how we got this far :)
